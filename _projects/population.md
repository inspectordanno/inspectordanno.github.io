A simple data visualization that shows projected urban population. View the [code](https://github.com/inspectordanno/urban_population).

All DOM manipulation is powered entirely by React, including the transitions. Amazing!

D3 is used for scale and arc generation.

The continent background images were generated in QGIS. Thanks Dylan!
