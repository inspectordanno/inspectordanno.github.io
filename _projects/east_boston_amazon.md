The work was inspired by my other East Boston project investigating rent affordability. Our professor wanted us to hypothesize how a hypothetical Amazon move to East Boston might affect the data we visualized. My group members and I decided to project out rent prices that would correspond to a variety of different increases. We also researched how Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood changed after Amazon moved in, and made some guesses about how East Boston population and density could be affected. -->
