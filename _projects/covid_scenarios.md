McKinsey conducts a regular survey with global executives about health and economic outcomes in various countries. This was a new interative offering that debuted in Fall 2020 as a supplement to existing survey material. I love the data visualization in this project. It uses familiar forms (heatmap, area chart, line chart), while also blending animation and interactivity.
