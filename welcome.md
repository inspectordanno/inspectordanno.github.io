I'm Dan. ðŸŽ‰ I'm a developer, designer, and data journalist in New York. I just finished up a temporary job as a graphics reporter at the [Wall Street Journal](https://graphics.wsj.com), where I did a lot of data visualization.

I'm looking for a front-end position right now. I love using JavaScript, React and D3.

I have a M.F.A. in [Information Design and Visualization](https://www.northeastern.edu/visualization/) from Northeastern University and a B.A. in Government from Cornell.

If you want to contact me, email is your best bet: spector at fastmail dot com.
