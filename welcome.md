I'm Dan. ðŸŽ‰ I'm a developer with a strong interest in data visualization, design, and journalism.

I'm currently working as web developer at McKinsey, where I make graphics and interactives for readers at McKinsey.com.

Previously, I worked as a graphics reporter at the Wall Street Journal, where I worked with coders, designers, and writers to visualize the news.

My homies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node, D3, R, and the written word.

I have a M.F.A. in [Information Design and Visualization](https://www.northeastern.edu/visualization/) from Northeastern University and a B.A. in Government from Cornell.

If you want to contact me, email is your best bet: spector at fastmail dot com.
