I'm Dan. ðŸŽ‰ I'm a front-end engineer with a strong interest in data visualization, design, and interactive experiences that educate and inspire.

I'm currently working as a front-end engineer and data visualization developer at McKinsey, where I make explainers for readers at [McKinsey.com](https://www.mckinsey.com).

Previously, I worked as a front-end engineer and graphics reporter at [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com), where I worked with coders, designers, and writers to visualize the news.

My homies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Svelte, Node, D3, R, and the written word.

I have a M.F.A. in [Information Design and Data Visualization](https://www.northeastern.edu/visualization/) from Northeastern University and a B.A. in Government from Cornell.

You can reach me at dspector -at- protonmail -dot- com.
