![dan_spector](/img/dan.jpg)

I'm a developer, designer, and data journalist in New York, working mostly with front-end web technologies. Previously, I was a graphics reporter at the [Wall Street Journal](https://graphics.wsj.com). I graduated with a master's degree in information design and data visualization from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/visualization/) in Boston.

## What I Like Doing
I enjoy making graphics and interactive toys to explain concepts and data. I especially like undertaking projects where I can build a narrative that presents a big idea. Most of my work utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like D3 and React. I also do data analysis in R and static design in Illustrator.

Iâ€™m also a firm believer in the power of words. Writing is my therapy.

## My Job Goals
I love working in roles where I serve the public interest through graphic design and code. I'm particularly interested in politics, economics, and sports. Professionally, I can see myself as a graphics reporter for a news organization, or an information designer in a storytelling capacity. However, building my skills and learning from others is definitely number one on my list, and I am flexible enough to adopt to a variety of web development roles.

## What I'm Doing Now 
### Updated 02-10-20

* I'm looking for a new job in the area of front-end development. I really love working with React in particular, and I also do a lot of data visualization work with D3. If you know anything in this general tech stack, please let me know!
