![dan_spector](/img/dan.jpg)

I'm a developer, designer, and writer, working mostly with front-end web technologies. I work as a graphics reporter at the [Wall Street Journal](https://graphics.wsj.com) in New York. I graduated with a master's degree in information design and data visualization from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/visualization/) in Boston.

## What I Like Doing
I enjoy making graphics and interactive toys to explain concepts and data. I especially like undertaking projects where I can build a narrative that presents a big idea. Most of my work utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like D3 and React. I also do data analysis in R and static design in Illustrator.

Iâ€™m also a firm believer in the power of words. Writing is my therapy.

## My Job Goals
I love working in roles where I serve the public interest through graphic design and code. I'm particularly interested in politics, economics, and sports. Professionally, I can see myself as a graphics reporter for a news organization, or an information designer in a storytelling capacity. However, building my skills and learning from others is definitely number one on my list, and I am flexible enough to adopt to a variety of web development roles.

## What I'm Doing Now 
### Updated 8-17-19

* I got a job as a graphics reporter at the Wall Street Journal!
* I'm done with grad school. For my thesis, I made a data storytelling project about why America should eliminate the penny. [View the website here!](https://penny.fyi) Please open it on desktop in Chrome or Safari. I'm working on a mobile version.
* Currently delving into the world of back-end by learning Node.js. [Andrew Mead is my hero.](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/)
* Learning how to live in New York. **Recently:**
  * I had my first [Katz's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katz%27s_Delicatessen) meal as a resident.
    * Get the gravy. On the side.
    * I know everyone opts for the pastrami, but the turkey is so underrated.
  * Cracked my phone through my pants while going through a subway turnstile, and got it fixed the next morning in 15 minutes. 
    * [At this place.](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ifix-shop-new-york-5)
  * Despite being a fan of [Michael McDonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McDonald_(musician)), I just learned that he was in [The Doobie Brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJe1iUuAW4M). 
    * The same thing happened to me a few years ago with Dave Grohl and Nirvana. 
    * This doesn't really have to do with living in New York.
