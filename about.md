I'm a developer, designer, and writer, working mostly with front-end web technologies. I study information design and data visualization
as a graduate student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/visualization/) in Boston, MA.

## What I Like Doing
I enjoy making graphics and interactive toys to explain concepts and data. I especially like undertaking projects where I can build a narrative that presents a big idea. Most of my work utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like D3.js.

Iâ€™m also a firm believer in the power of words. Writing is my therapy.

## My Job Goals
I love working in roles where I serve the public interest through graphic design and code. I'm particularly interested in politics, economics, and sports. Professionally, I can see myself as a graphics reporter for a news organization, or an information designer in a storytelling capacity. However, building my skills and learning from others is definitely number one on my list, and I am flexible enough to adopt to a variety of front-end roles.

## What I'm Doing Now (Updated 10-04-18)
* Starting my thesis as part of my final year of classes. I'm using data visualization to answer the question: "What is the second most popular professional sport in America?"
* Learning React from a great [course](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/) by Andrew Mead on Udemy.
* Teaching myself piano.
* Starting a blog, because the writing folder on my desktop is getting a bit stale.
