## Howdy!
I'm Dan. ðŸŽ‰ I'm a developer, designer, and writer. I study information design and data visualization
as a graduate student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/visualization/) in Boston, MA.

## What I Like Doing
I enjoy making graphics and interactive toys to explain concepts and data. I especially like undertaking projects where I can build a narrative that presents a big idea. Most of my work utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like D3.js.

Iâ€™m also a firm believer in the power of words. Writing is my therapy.

## My Job Goals
I love working in roles where I serve the public interest through graphic design and code. I'm particularly interested in politics, economics, and sports. Professionally, I can see myself as a graphics reporter for a news organization, or an information designer in a storytelling capacity. However, building my skills and learning from others is definitely number one on my list, and I am flexible enough to adopt to a variety of front-end roles.

## What I'm Doing Now (Updated 9-13-18)
* Starting my thesis as part of my final year of classes. I'm investigating the changing fan experience of Major League Baseball. Viewers are getting older, less people are going to games, and the game is often criticized for being slow and slow to adapt. I'm using data visualization to investigate how baseball is changing in American culture and if anything can be done to address it.
* Learning React from a great [course](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/) by Andrew Mead on Udemy.
* Teaching myself piano.
* Starting a blog, because the writing folder on my desktop is getting a bit stale.
