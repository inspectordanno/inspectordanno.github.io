![dan_spector](/img/dan.jpg)

I'm a developer, designer, and writer, working mostly with front-end web technologies. I just graduated with a master's degree in information design and data visualization from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/visualization/) in Boston, MA.

## What I Like Doing
I enjoy making graphics and interactive toys to explain concepts and data. I especially like undertaking projects where I can build a narrative that presents a big idea. Most of my work utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like D3 and React.

Iâ€™m also a firm believer in the power of words. Writing is my therapy.

## My Job Goals
I love working in roles where I serve the public interest through graphic design and code. I'm particularly interested in politics, economics, and sports. Professionally, I can see myself as a graphics reporter for a news organization, or an information designer in a storytelling capacity. However, building my skills and learning from others is definitely number one on my list, and I am flexible enough to adopt to a variety of front-end development roles.

## What I'm Doing Now 
### Updated 5-01-19
* I'm done with grad school! For my thesis, I made a data storytelling project about why America should eliminate the penny. [View the website here!](https://penny.fyi) Please open it on desktop in Chrome or Safari. I'm working on a mobile version.
* I'm looking for a job as a web developer. While data visualization is my passion, my broader goal is to get some work experience and keep on learning.
* I'm learning React from a great [course](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/) by Andrew Mead on Udemy.
